# 📚 AI-Powered Research Assistant

An AI-powered Research Assistant web app that helps students, researchers, and professors find and summarize academic papers based on a given topic using the **Semantic Scholar API** and **OpenAI/Hugging Face models**.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

In today’s fast-paced academic environment, researchers and students face significant challenges in keeping up with the ever-growing volume of scholarly publications. With thousands of new papers published daily, it becomes increasingly difficult to identify and understand the most relevant and high-quality research.

### Challenges:
- Time constraints for literature review
- Difficulty understanding complex academic writing
- Lack of tools to filter and summarize research efficiently

A smart research assistant can solve this by:
- Searching multiple academic databases
- Generating concise summaries
- Extracting key insights like methodology, objectives, and conclusions
- Supporting better academic decisions

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

This project aims to build an **AI-Powered Research Agent** that streamlines the literature review process.

### 🔍 Core Features:
- Accepts a **research topic** input
- Fetches **top academic papers** using the Semantic Scholar API
- Summarizes the content using **advanced NLP models** (e.g., BART, T5)
- Displays summarized results in a user-friendly web app interface

---

## 🛠️ System Development Approach

### 🚀 Technologies Used:
- **Streamlit** – Web interface
- **Python** – Core backend language
- **Semantic Scholar API** – For retrieving research papers
- **Hugging Face Transformers** – For text summarization
- **Pyngrok** – To deploy Streamlit apps via Google Colab

---

## ⚙️ System Requirements

### Hardware:
- Minimum 4 GB RAM
- Stable Internet connection

### Software:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Google Colab or any local IDE

### Required Python Libraries:
```bash
pip install streamlit pyngrok requests transformers pillow
````

## 🧪 Algorithm & Deployment Flow

1. User enters a topic or keyword.
2. App fetches papers using **Semantic Scholar API**.
3. Abstracts or key sections are sent to Hugging Face model (like `BART`, `T5`, etc.) for summarization.
4. Summarized output is displayed on the **Streamlit** UI.
5. Hosted via **Pyngrok** for Colab access or local use.

## ✅ Conclusion

The **AI Research Agent** effectively combines NLP, semantic search, and summarization to automate academic research. It:

* Reduces time and effort for literature review
* Helps both novice and expert researchers
* Encourages efficient exploration of academic content
* Demonstrates practical use of AI in real-world academic workflows

---

## 🔮 Future Scope

* **Multi-source Integration:** IEEE, PubMed, Springer, ArXiv support
* **Advanced Summarization:** Use domain-specific or fine-tuned models
* **Conversational Chatbot:** Transform into a Q\&A assistant
* **Citation Management:** Export summaries with citation formats (APA, MLA, etc.)
* **Multilingual Support:** Summarize papers in different languages
